# NodeJS Todo Frontend
This project was create in order to learn how to create a seperate frontend and backend using VueJs and Node Express. This also doesn't have a name because I'm bad with names.

A simple interface that uses a NodeJs API built [here](https://github.com/PhuLN/mongodb-todo).
Users can sign up and create their own group from which they can invite others. Users inside the same group will have access to the same todo list (think of Trello, but not as good)


## Features

* Authentication system using a username and password (No OAuth2 though)
* Easy group creation
* Real time updates (group invites, todo changes)
* Very basic overview of a group's todolist (late, completed table with details, basic graphs, etc)
* Member management with a click of a button (adding and removing members from your group can be done in seconds)
* Full (?) english and french translation
